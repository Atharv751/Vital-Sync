🎯 Problem We’re Solving

Every year, thousands of patients suffer post-surgery complications that could have been prevented with better monitoring.
Currently, recovery tracking is manual, inconsistent, and often ignored once patients leave the hospital — leading to delayed interventions and unnecessary risks.

💡 Our Solution – Vital Sync

A modern, AI-powered recovery platform that patients and doctors can rely on to:
✅ Track healing progress daily
✅ Detect risks early with AI wound analysis
✅ Keep doctors informed with smart alerts
✅ Provide peace of mind to patients & families

✨ Key Features

🔐 Secure Login & Role-Based Access – Patients and doctors have separate dashboards.

🧑‍⚕️ Doctor Verification – Medical professionals must upload valid documents for approval.

📊 Personalized Recovery Dashboard – Track pain levels, mobility, wound healing, and medications in one place.

🤖 AI-Powered Wound Risk Detection – Upload wound images, and the AI flags potential infection risks (Low/Medium/High).

📢 Real-Time Alerts – Doctors are notified if a patient’s condition trends toward complication.

🌗 Dark Mode & Light Mode – Professional and accessible design for all users.

🎨 Visual Placeholders for Medical Imagery – Ready for future illustrations/photos to make the UI more engaging.
